AI-Driven Multimodal Posture and Action Analysis for Detecting Workplace Fatigue

Introduction:
This script performs real-time drowsiness and head-down detection using a webcam. It uses:
•	YOLOv11 (a custom-trained object detection model) to classify the user's state (Drowsy, Awake)
•	MediaPipe to detect facial landmarks and calculate eye aspect ratio (EAR) for fatigue detection
•	Streamlit to display the live feed and stats in a web interface
•	Tkinter to show popup alerts when drowsiness or head-down is detected

Software Used:
Execution Platform:     VS Studios with all libraries installed 
			All dependencies are installed using pip install <command> . 
The list includes various python libraries such as OpenCV, Scripy library, ultralytics library (used for YOLO), Mediapipe (for face mesh), streamlit library and may more. 
Supported Language:   python 

Instructions to Execute the code:
Set up the environment 
For Windows as in this case, 
	Open terminal
	Open the location of the code using cd < path> command
	streamlit run <file_name>.py   // here the file name "finalcode"
(ensure the libraries are installed and updated)
